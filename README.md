# Introduction
In todayâ€™s competitive beauty and skincare market, an efficient and responsive supply chain is crucial for meeting customer demands and maintaining a strong market position. This project focuses on analyzing the supply chain of a fashion and beauty startup, specifically dealing with makeup products. By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), optimization, and reporting, we aim to uncover valuable insights to drive decision-making and improve supply chain performance.

The analysis covers various aspects of the supply chain, including product distribution, pricing, availability, transportation modes, and routes. Additionally, we will calculate optimal order quantities, monitor supply gaps, and highlight key issues such as high defect rates. The ultimate goal is to enhance overall efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure timely product delivery to the market.
